## Introduction
This Java-based project simulates a battery management system that connects energy sources to batteries, managing charging and energy usage with concurrency. The system includes features for controlling overload and enabling multithreaded operations.

## Features
- **Define Energy Sources and Batteries**: Add and list energy sources and batteries with specified names, power, and capacities.
- **Connect and Charge**: Connect an energy source to a battery, triggering concurrent charging.
- **Concurrency Management**: Efficiently handle charging and energy usage across multiple threads, with overload control.

## Roles
- **Hadis Delbord**: Added menu commands to define and list energy sources and batteries, and to connect energy sources to batteries.
- **Yug Dharmeshkumar Dave**: Implemented the multithreaded simulation of energy usage, created `EnergyUser.java`, and updated `Battery.java` to handle overload control.
- **Amir Hossein Pakdel**: Conducted research on concurrency models and contributed documentation on concurrency concepts.
